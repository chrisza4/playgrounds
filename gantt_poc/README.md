## Gantt test

Testing implement gantt chart on react

This project is create base on create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md).

Also using gantt component from [here](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGantt/)

Basically, what I try to do is import the gantt chart and change it to react component.

The external component is written in native javascript. I use built version and put it on `/lib`
